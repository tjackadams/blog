Ah, the good old problem in production that no one saw coming. It was a warm summers day I think, possibly on hump day and we had reports that users sessions were not expiring as they should.\
The particular website was built on ASP.NET Core 3.1 ðŸ‘Œ running on IIS  ðŸ¤® and had a relatively short idle session limit set to 20 minutes.

## Let the investigation begin! ðŸ™Œ

First port of call as always was to check the session was configured correctly. You can find this is the \`Startup.cs\` file.

```csharp
services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20);
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
});
```
