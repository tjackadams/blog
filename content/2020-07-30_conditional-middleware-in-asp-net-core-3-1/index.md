Ah, the good old problem in production that no one saw coming. It was a warm summers day I think, possibly on hump day and we had reports that users sessions were not expiring as they should.\
The particular website was built on ASP.NET Core 3.1 ðŸ‘Œ running on IIS  ðŸ¤® and had a relatively short idle session limit set to 20 minutes.

## Let the investigation begin! ðŸ™Œ

First port of call as always was to check the session was configured correctly. You can find this is the \`Startup.cs\` file.

```csharp
services.AddSession(options =>
{
    options.IdleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(20);
    options.Cookie.IsEssential = true;
    options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
    options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.None;
    options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
});
```

As you can see the `IdleTimeout` is correctly set to 20 minutes and the rest of the settings are purely to satisfy [Chrome against insecure cookies](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5633521622188032).

The log files didn't really provide anything useful in regards to this, so why are sessions not expiring when they should?

## Taking a deeper look

The \`IdleTimeout\` for the session is a sliding timeout. So in order for the session to not expire after 20 minutes, something must be hitting the application with those 20 minutes, right? So, we did a little experiment. Make a request to the application to initiate a session, wait longer than 20 minutes and see if the session expired. It did not ðŸ˜¥

This is both good and bad. Good that we can reproduce the issue, bad that its not working as intended, *although some people could view it differently* ðŸ‘€

We needed some way to track the requests coming into the application to see what what keeping the session alive. Luckily, Serilog has some middleware that can provide [request logging](https://github.com/serilog/serilog-aspnetcore) for us. I won't go into too much detail  on how to setup or configure this, but it basically boils down to this in you \`Startup.cs\`.

```csharp
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env)
{
    app.UseSerilogRequestLogging();

    // Other app configuration
}
```
